    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to perform an initial exploration of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Dataset. We will load the data, understand its structure, and visualize the vibration signals for different fault conditions. This foundational analysis is crucial for guiding our subsequent preprocessing and modeling decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Activities:**\n",
    "- **Load Data:** Import vibration signal data from the `.mat` files.\n",
    "- **Inspect Structure:** Examine the shape, data types, and key components of the raw signals.\n",
    "- **Visualize Signals:** Plot the time-domain waveforms for each bearing condition (Normal, Inner Race Fault, Outer Race Fault, Ball Fault).\n",
    "- **Analyze Frequency Domain:** Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to visualize the frequency content of the signals and identify characteristic fault frequencies."
